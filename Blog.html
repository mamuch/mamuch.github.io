                <p>There is not a single movie theater in South Sudan, the <br /> world’s newest nation. But that doesn’t mean the <br /> people of the war-riven countryaren’t movie buffs.<br /> In the absence of an organized local film-making <br /> industry,
                    the “enormous appetite” for stories is <br /> satisfied by pirated Hollywood movies passed around on <br /> DVDs and USB sticks, Internews explains. But in the capital city,<br /> Juba, a gang of 20 merry South Sudanese filmmakers

                <p>Twenty South Sudanese filmmakers are taking part in the film festival with the aim of creating four movies before the festival ends in July. These films will be screened at the festival’s end, July 7, two days before South Sudan’s independence.
                    The film festival started last month in April with a workshop and pop-up film school for young filmmakers. Barefoot Workshops, a not-for-profit body offering workshops in documentary film making; and What Took You So Long, experts
                    in guerrilla filmmaking acted as mentors for the festival. Experienced filmmakers from both organizations shared techniques and industry insights with the public and high school students.</p>

                <p>Hundreds of South Sudanese people are flocking to the capital Juba, huddling around cinema screens to watch dramatic fictional tales and powerful documentaries about their country’s short history. The world’s youngest country, which only
                    obtained independence from its northern neighbor Sudan in 2011, is currently hosting its first-ever movie gala. Running from Monday until Thursday July 7, the Juba Film Festival is showcasing the work of local and international filmmakers
                    in a bid to change perceptions of a country that, outside its borders, is largely associated with the horrors of war.</p>

                <p>“This is the beginning,” says filmmaker Simon Bingo. “The beginning of something big.” And a beginning it is. The first ever South Sudan film industry conference has just been held in Juba. Bringing together filmmakers and media professionals
                    from a diverse group of companies and organizations, the event was focused on cooperation and mapping out an agenda for a small but determined creative industry.</p>
