                <p id="spara">Endurance Films Inc. is focused on continuing the production of feature films, and is open to collaboration with other filmmakers.<br />.<br /> The Human Experience was Endurance Films Inc. first feature length documentary. The film had
                    a theatrical release in the East Africa, and a grand opening in Juba and Nairobi before gaining distribution. We continue to strive in this field as a valuable player among the millions of film companies today. What makes us different
                    is our desire to create films that entertain, and inspire. Currently we have begun production on a new documentary that is focused on a group of monks living to serve others. Expected release date is Spring of 2017. .<br />.<br />                    We are also exploring the possibilities of collaborating with other companies and film makers from all over the globe. We find that through these positive relationships we are able to build a trusted community of film makers interested
                    in making a difference.<br />

                    from a diverse group of companies and organizations, the event was focused on cooperation and mapping out an agenda for a small but determined creative industry.</p>
